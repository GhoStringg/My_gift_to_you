Hello baby. This is the very first message for you. Ever since that day when we had our early Christmas celebration together, there has not been a single day na hindi ko tinitignan itong picture natin. That day was filled with so much happiness and laughter. Ang dami kong na experience with you and ang dami kong bagong bagay na nakita because I was with you. You made everything feel more exciting and more meaningful just by being there beside me.

These kinds of pictures of us are something I will always treasure deeply. They are not just photos. They hold memories that we can always go back to and talk about. Every time I look at this, I remember how I felt in that exact moment. I remember how happy and content I was. Just like this site that will always stay here, these memories will stay with me forever. And along with those memories, nandito lang din palagi yung feelings ko for you, steady and true.

My favorite picture of you. I do not think you fully realize how beautiful you are here. It is not only about how you look, but the softness in your expression and the warmth that shows in your eyes. Every time I stare at this photo, I find myself falling harder all over again. Especially when I look into your eyes. Parang doon pa lang, panalo na ako.

This picture makes me miss you in the gentlest way. It feels like you are right in front of me again, smiling, existing, being you. I could stare at this for minutes and still feel the same admiration. Seeing this reminds me how lucky I am to be the one who gets to be close to you and share moments like this with you.

We look so cute together here. Every time I see this photo, I cannot help but smile because we just look so right beside each other. Parang bagay na bagay tayo. There is something very natural about how we are in this picture. It does not feel forced. It just feels right.

Looking at this makes me imagine all the future pictures we will take together. Different places, different days, different outfits, but still the same two people choosing each other every time. This photo feels like a small proof that we fit together in a way that is simple and genuine.

This picture makes me think about our future in the simplest and happiest way. I can really imagine us walking around stores, shopping for each other, laughing at random things, and arguing about what to buy. Those simple scenarios make me smile because I want to experience all of that with you.

I do not dream about big and grand moments. I dream about being with you no matter where. Because with you, even the simplest activities become special. Just being beside you already feels like enough.

This hand painted frame of us will always be one of the cutest memories we share. This day felt so light, so warm, and so full of happiness. I remember how comfortable and peaceful I felt just being there with you.

Whenever I think about this memory, I feel a sense of comfort in my heart. It is one of those days that I can replay in my mind whenever I want to feel that same happiness again. This will always have a special place in my heart because it reminds me how soft and genuine our moments together can be.

I just love this day so much. Everything about it felt perfect to me. Following you around and seeing your back as you walked in front of me, I felt like a child at that moment. The way you hold my hand and lead the way. I felt safe. I felt like I could truly depend on you and rely on you without worries.

I did not want that day to end. I wanted to stay in that moment for a little longer. I wanted to act more carefree and more childlike in front of you because with you, I feel safe enough to be that way. You make me feel protected in a way that is quiet but very real.
---
I remember that you were also supposed to have a picture here, pero huhu yung camera and hindi nasave yung sayo. Sayang talaga because I wanted us to both have a copy of this moment haysss

This photo made me realize I do not actually hate how I look in pictures kapag ikaw yung kumukuha. The way you see me and capture me makes me feel appreciated and seen in a way that feels genuine. You make me feel confident without even trying. Kyoti mo kaya kapag gusto mo ako kuhanan ng picture, mama ko yan? AHHAHAHAHA mwaamwamwamwaaaa

Happy monthsary and Happy valentines baby!

When I first met you and fnally got to look into your eyes, I felt something shift inside me. Parang doon pa lang, alam ko na that you were going to be someone very important in my life. Seeing you made me want to protect you, care for you, and stay by your side in ways I never felt before. That moment still lives very clearly in my heart, and every time I remember it, I feel the same warmth and certainty.

Thinking about us makes my mind wander in so many directions because we have already shared so much together. From our very first moments, to the chaotic and scary ones that tested us, we were always there for each other. We stayed. We chose to understand. We chose to hold on. And that is something I will always be proud of. I want to keep having that with you. Yung kahit ano pa ang harapin natin, we will always face it together.

I want to make more memories with you. Memories we can laugh about someday. Memories we might even cry about but still be thankful for. I want us to learn new things from each other, experience things for the first time together, try things we never imagined doing, and explore parts of life we have not seen yet. I do not know where the future will take us, but what makes me calm is knowing that whatever happens, the keyword will always be together.

You made me into a better person in ways you probably do not even notice. You made me softer but stronger. You made me confident but still humble. You made me feel seen, appreciated, and loved for who I really am. With you, I felt the happiest I have ever been. You did not just like me. You understood me. You saw every part of me and still chose to love me without hesitation.

I look forward to the day I get to spoil you and give you the things you deserve. I cannot wait to treat you to the plans and ideas I keep thinking about. I get excited just imagining the simple days we will spend together in the future. Walking around, talking about random things, laughing at nothing, and just enjoying each other’s presence.

This day and this memory will always be something I hold on to. It reminds me why I am grateful for you and why I will keep choosing you every single day. You are the best plot twist of my life, the greatest blessing I have, and the person I want to protect and love for a very long time.

I love what we are. I love how we are together. And I will always do my best to take care of what we have.


I love you always, mahal ko.
